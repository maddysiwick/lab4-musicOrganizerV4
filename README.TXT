This project is part of the material for the book

   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object. This will scan the default audio 
folder for any mp3 files. The default folder is the one named
"audio", in the same directory as the project folder.

You can place your own mp3 files into this folder to include and 
play them. Just make sure the filename is of the expected format: 

  artist name-track name.mp3
